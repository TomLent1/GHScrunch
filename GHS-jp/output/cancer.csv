Although IARC (1999) was defined as Goup 3 since the evidence of carcinogenicityity in animals was restrictive, EU-RAR (2003) and NICNAS (2000) are defined as Carcinogenicityity Category 3, R40 due to the fact that carcinogenesis tests have not been performed in animal species other than rats and that whether the carcinogenicityity is specific to the species (rats) cannot be determined, and also the fact that carcinogenicityity in humans cannot be denied only from the rat tumors since the carcinogenicity mechanism is not clear even though it is caused by nongenotoxic mechanism. Adopting the view of EU-RAR (2003) and NICNAS (2000), it was defined as Category 2. In addition, ACGIH (2003) reported that lung adenomas besides tumors in liver, nasal cavity, laryngeal were observed in the rats after inhalation exposure, and it was classified as A3, equivalent to the GHS Category 2.

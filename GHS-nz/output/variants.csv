In addition, chlorine dioxide and sodium chlorite are used as material preservatives and as disinfectants. At this time, products containing chlorine dioxide and sodium chlorite are intended for agricultural, commercial, industrial, medical and residential use. The agricultural premises and equipment uses include the disinfection of hard surfaces and equipment (such as hatching facilities and mushroom houses).
US Department of Agriculture: Chlorine dioxide gas was also demonstrated to reduce pests in soil, such as nematodes, fungi and weeds that are detrimental to plants, and could be a potential alternative for methyl bromide, a widely used soil fumigant.

When dimethylamine was added to stream water, the maximum rate of biodegradation was proportional to the initial amine concentration over a concentration range from several nanograms to several milligrams per liter(1). At the highest concentration studied, 10 mg/l, the half-life of dimethylamine was 1.5 days(1,SRC). In 4 days all of the dimethylamine was mineralized when the initial concentration ranged from 2.8 parts per trillion to 90 ppb, while 90% was mineralized when the concentration was 18 ppm(2). The half-life in Vistula River water (Warsaw, Poland) was 1.6 days after a 0.3 day lag(3). When 250 ppm dimethylamine was added to a fine sand loam and sandy soil amended with sewage and nitrite-N, 50% degradation occurred in 2 days in the sand loam, while 20% degradation occurred in the sandy soil(4). N-nitrosodimethylamine was formed in the degradation(4). 50 to >90% degradation occurred in four silt loam or loam soils within 14 days(5). Under anaerobic conditions, one of the silt loam soils tested required 35 days to achieve 86% removal of dimethylamine(5).

Using the mixture rules as no data for mixture (calculated with the highest concentration of MEKP as that is the most toxic component): 100/ LC50 mix = 40/1.23 + 60/9.3 + 0/32 = 38.95  (used these percentages as they give the worst case for toxicity) thus LC50mix = 2.57 mg/L.

An estimated BCF of 13 was calculated for the 2-butanone peroxide mixture(SRC), using an estimated log Kow of 2(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Chemical degradation is expected to be the dominant fate process in water because of reaction with organic matter and therefore, it is doubtful that un-reacted 2-butanone peroxide would be biologically available(SRC).

_v0_156-62-7,"Calcium cyanamide, with >0.1 % calcium carbide",9.2D,Slightly harmful in the soil environment,,"A review of the literature is presented to reconcile conflicting reports on the effect of calcium cyanamide on soil microflora. Since 1906, it has been reported by various researchers that the application of calcium cyanamide to the soil reduces the microfloral population. During the same time, other authors have found that calcium cyanamide treatment increases the number of soil microflora. It was found that within 24 hr after application, the soil microflora was reduced by 80 to 99%. When observed for a longer period of time, it was found that calcium cyanamide affected a population increase of about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times that found in untreated and ammonium-sulfate-treated soils within 30 days. In acidic soil, this increase was slower and was about equal to that found in the untreated and ammonium-sulfate-treated samples after 88 days. The intensity of the effect was a function both of the type of the soil and the concentration of the calcium cyanamide. It is concluded from the findings that calcium cyanamide promotes microbiological activity but it is also pointed out that Drude (1960) found that high concentrations of calcium cyanamide (300 kg nitrogen/ha) had a damaging effect (|cyanamide shock|) on the development of young sugar and feed beets
Glathe 1971 Calcium cyanamide and the soil microflora.)  Z. Pflanzenernaehr. Bodenk.; 128(1): 41-50 1971 [toxline]
Soil DT 50 > 30 days: no
In fertilizer applications, Calcium cyanamide is broken down
by soil moisture into lime and free cyanamide. The latter is
converted by soil microbes to urea and then to ammonia.
Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia to nitrate. Calcium
cyanamide is particularly valuable for acid soils in need of
lime.

An estimated BCF value of 13 was calculated for 2,5-dinitrophenol (SRC), using a log Kow of 1.75(1) and a recommended regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF value suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.

Result: The different effects of inhaled formaldehyde on the intact or damaged nasal epithelium were studied. Groups of 30 rats with intact noses and groups of 60 rats with damaged noses were used. Nose damage was set by electro-coagulation of
the nasal cavity. After termination of the exposure, investigations on general health, autopsy, measurement of organ weights, and histopathology of the nose were
performed.  The electro-coagulation without exposure resulted in perforation of the nasal septum, loss of turbinates, high incidence of squamous metaplasia (increase of up to 46%),
hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium (11%), and rhinitis (50%). Exposure to 9.2 ppm for 28 months resulted in growth retardation, focal rhinits (69%), squamous metaplasia
(increase of up to 96%) and basal cell hyperplasia (54%) of the respiratory epithelium, and degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (27%) in the anterior nose in rats with undamaged noses. In rats with damaged noses, the same histopathological lesions were found, however, these lesions were more severe. Exposure to 9.2 ppm after nasal damage
caused squamous metaplasia (increase of up to 82%) and basal cell hyperplasia (41%) of the respiratory epithelium, degeneration (31%), squamous metaplasia (19%) and basal cell
hyperplasia (21%) of the olfactory epithelium, and rhinitis (71%). In rats exposed to 1.0 ppm after nose damaging squamous metaplasia (increaseof up to 57%) and basal cell
hyperplasia (29%) of the respiratory epithelium, and rhinitis (70%) were observed. After exposure to 0.1 ppm, squamous metaplasia (maximum increase of 66%) and basal cell
hyperplasia (14%) of the respiratory epithelium, and rhinitis (78%) were found in rats with damaged noses. No significant influence of exposure to 1.0 or 0.1 ppm of the test substance on electrocoagulation damage was found. According to the authors, the NOAEL was 1 ppm for rats with intact nasal epithelium.

Clary.  1989.  Two-year drinking water study of formaldehyde in rats.  Food 
Chem. Toxicol.  27: 77-87. 

Formaldehyde was administered daily in drinking water to Wistar rats 
(70/sex/dose) for up to 24 months at mean doses of 0, 1.2, 15, or 82 mg/kg/day  for males and 0, 1.8, 21, or 109 mg/kg/day for females.  Up to 10 rats/sex/dose were sacrificed and examined after 12 months and 18 months of treatment; the remainder was sacrificed and examined at 24 months.  Mean body weights of the high-dose group were decreased in males from week 1 and in females from week 24 through termination.  Food intake was significantly decreased in all high-dose males with females showing a similar but less 
consistent decrease in food intake.  A 40% decrease in drinking water intake was reported in all high-dose animals while those rats receiving the middle dose showed a slight but generally insignificant decrease in liquid intake.  Changes in urinalyses, and hematological and clinical chemistry parameters, were not dose-related, so were not considered to be related to formaldehyde intake.  Among the high-dose males, significant decreases were seen in the absolute heart and liver weights at 18 months and at termination; in testes weights at 18 months; and in kidney weights at termination.  High-dose females showed significant increases in the relative kidney weights at 12 and 24 
months.  Relative brain weights were significantly increased in high-dose males at all three examination periods and in females at termination only.  Relative testes weights were significantly increased in high-dose males at termination.  These relative organ weight increases were generally ascribed to the decreased body weights observed.  A significant increase in mortality among males receiving the 15 mg/kg/day dose was not considered toxicologically significant. Gross examination at 12, 18, and 24 months revealed a raised, thickening of the limiting ridge of the forestomach in most high-dose rats and in some rats of both sexes from other groups.  Irregular mucosal thickening of the forestomach and glandular stomach were seen in several rats of the high-dose 
group and in occasional rats of other groups.  The incidence of discoloration and irregularity of the kidney surface and atrophy of the testes was lower in the high-dose group as compared with controls. Significant histopathological changes of the gastrointestinal tract were found in high-dose males and females and included chronic atrophic gastritis of the glandular stomach from week 53 on, as well as focal ulceration and glandular hyperplasia at the terminal examination.  The incidence of focal papillary 
epithelial hyperplasia and focal hyperkeratosis of the forestomach was significantly increased in both sexes at the terminal examination.  These effects of formaldehyde on the gastric mucosa were considered cytotoxic in nature.  A significant increase in the incidence of papillary necrosis of the kidneys was reported in both sexes of high-dose rats at the terminal examination.  No treatment-related gastric tumors were observed in this study. The incidence and type of tumors observed in other organ systems were common 
to this strain and similar to those found in aging rats, 30 were not considered toxicologically significant.  A NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day in male rats was indicated in this study. [IRIS]

Clary.  1989.  Two-year drinking water study of formaldehyde in rats.  Food 
Chem. Toxicol.  27: 77-87. 

Formaldehyde was administered daily in drinking water to Wistar rats 
(70/sex/dose) for up to 24 months at mean doses of 0, 1.2, 15, or 82 mg/kg/day 
for males and 0, 1.8, 21, or 109 mg/kg/day for females.  Up to 10 
rats/sex/dose were sacrificed and examined after 12 months and 18 months of 
treatment; the remainder was sacrificed and examined at 24 months.  Mean body 
weights of the high-dose group were decreased in males from week 1 and in 
females from week 24 through termination.  Food intake was significantly 
decreased in all high-dose males with females showing a similar but less 
consistent decrease in food intake.  A 40% decrease in drinking water intake 
was reported in all high-dose animals while those rats receiving the middle 
dose showed a slight but generally insignificant decrease in liquid intake.  
Changes in urinalyses, and hematological and clinical chemistry parameters, 
were not dose-related, so were not considered to be related to formaldehyde 
intake.  Among the high-dose males, significant decreases were seen in the 
absolute heart and liver weights at 18 months and at termination; in testes 
weights at 18 months; and in kidney weights at termination.  High-dose females 
showed significant increases in the relative kidney weights at 12 and 24 
months.  Relative brain weights were significantly increased in high-dose 
males at all three examination periods and in females at termination only.  
Relative testes weights were significantly increased in high-dose males at 
termination.  These relative organ weight increases were generally ascribed to 
the decreased body weights observed.  A significant increase in mortality 
among males receiving the 15 mg/kg/day dose was not considered toxicologically 
significant. 
Gross examination at 12, 18, and 24 months revealed a raised, thickening of 
the limiting ridge of the forestomach in most high-dose rats and in some rats 
of both sexes from other groups.  Irregular mucosal thickening of the 
forestomach and glandular stomach were seen in several rats of the high-dose 
group and in occasional rats of other groups.  The incidence of discoloration 
and irregularity of the kidney surface and atrophy of the testes was lower in 
the high-dose group as compared with controls. 
Significant histopathological changes of the gastrointestinal tract were found 
in high-dose males and females and included chronic atrophic gastritis of the 
glandular stomach from week 53 on, as well as focal ulceration and glandular 
hyperplasia at the terminal examination.  The incidence of focal papillary 
epithelial hyperplasia and focal hyperkeratosis of the forestomach was 
significantly increased in both sexes at the terminal examination.  These 
effects of formaldehyde on the gastric mucosa were considered cytotoxic in 
nature.  A significant increase in the incidence of papillary necrosis of the 
kidneys was reported in both sexes of high-dose rats at the terminal 
examination.  No treatment-related gastric tumors were observed in this study.  
The incidence and type of tumors observed in other organ systems were common 
to this strain and similar to those found in aging rats, 30 were not 
considered toxicologically significant.  A NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day in male rats 
was indicated in this study.

treatment; the remainder was sacrificed and examined at 24 months.  Mean body 
weights of the high-dose group were decreased in males from week 1 and in 
females from week 24 through termination.  Food intake was significantly 
decreased in all high-dose males with females showing a similar but less 
consistent decrease in food intake.  A 40% decrease in drinking water intake 
was reported in all high-dose animals while those rats receiving the middle 
dose showed a slight but generally insignificant decrease in liquid intake.  
Changes in urinalyses, and hematological and clinical chemistry parameters, 
were not dose-related, so were not considered to be related to formaldehyde 
intake.  Among the high-dose males, significant decreases were seen in the 
absolute heart and liver weights at 18 months and at termination; in testes 
weights at 18 months; and in kidney weights at termination.  High-dose females 
showed significant increases in the relative kidney weights at 12 and 24 
months.  Relative brain weights were significantly increased in high-dose 
males at all three examination periods and in females at termination only.  
Relative testes weights were significantly increased in high-dose males at 
termination.  These relative organ weight increases were generally ascribed to 
the decreased body weights observed.  A significant increase in mortality 
among males receiving the 15 mg/kg/day dose was not considered toxicologically 
significant. 
Gross examination at 12, 18, and 24 months revealed a raised, thickening of 
the limiting ridge of the forestomach in most high-dose rats and in some rats 
of both sexes from other groups.  Irregular mucosal thickening of the 
forestomach and glandular stomach were seen in several rats of the high-dose 
group and in occasional rats of other groups.  The incidence of discoloration 
and irregularity of the kidney surface and atrophy of the testes was lower in 
the high-dose group as compared with controls. 
Significant histopathological changes of the gastrointestinal tract were found 
in high-dose males and females and included chronic atrophic gastritis of the 
glandular stomach from week 53 on, as well as focal ulceration and glandular 
hyperplasia at the terminal examination.  The incidence of focal papillary 
epithelial hyperplasia and focal hyperkeratosis of the forestomach was 
significantly increased in both sexes at the terminal examination.  These 
effects of formaldehyde on the gastric mucosa were considered cytotoxic in 
nature.  A significant increase in the incidence of papillary necrosis of the 
kidneys was reported in both sexes of high-dose rats at the terminal 
examination.  No treatment-related gastric tumors were observed in this study.

Result: The different effects of inhaled formaldehyde on the intact or damaged nasal epithelium were studied. Groups of 30 rats with intact noses and groups of 60 rats with damaged noses were used. Nose damage was set by electro-coagulation of
the nasal cavity. After termination of the exposure, investigations on general health, autopsy, measurement of organ weights, and histopathology of the nose were
performed.  The electro-coagulation without exposure resulted in perforation of the nasal septum, loss of turbinates, high incidence of squamous metaplasia (increase of up to 46%),
hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium (11%), and rhinitis (50%). Exposure to 9.2 ppm for 28 months resulted in growth retardation, focal rhinits (69%), squamous metaplasia
(increase of up to 96%) and basal cell hyperplasia (54%) of the respiratory epithelium, and degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (27%) in the anterior nose in rats with undamaged noses. In rats with damaged noses, the same histopathological lesions were found, however, these lesions were more severe. Exposure to 9.2 ppm after nasal damage
caused squamous metaplasia (increase of up to 82%) and basal cell hyperplasia (41%) of the respiratory epithelium, degeneration (31%), squamous metaplasia (19%) and basal cell
hyperplasia (21%) of the olfactory epithelium, and rhinitis (71%). In rats exposed to 1.0 ppm after nose damaging squamous metaplasia (increaseof up to 57%) and basal cell
hyperplasia (29%) of the respiratory epithelium, and rhinitis (70%) were observed. After exposure to 0.1 ppm, squamous metaplasia (maximum increase of 66%) and basal cell
hyperplasia (14%) of the respiratory epithelium, and rhinitis (78%) were found in rats with damaged noses. No significant influence of exposure to 1.0 or 0.1 ppm of the test substance on electrocoagulation damage was found. According to the authors, the NOAEL was 1 ppm for rats with intact nasal epithelium.

Principal and Supporting Studies (Oral RfD):  Over 100 anecdotal cases of cataracts resulting from therapeutic use of 2,4- dinitrophenol were reviewed.  The length of time and amount of drug taken  varied among the population.  It was estimated that over 1% of the population  administered 2,4-dinitrophenol developed cataracts.  Data did not allow for calculation of a NOEL; cataracts were observed in patients receiving as little as 2 mg/kg/day, the lower range of the recommended therapeutic dose. (Horner, W.D.  1942.  Dinitrophenol and its relation to formation of cataracts.  Arch. Ophthal.  27: 1097.)

Soil DT 50 > 30 days: no
TERRESTRIAL FATE: Based on a classification scheme(1), an estimated Koc value of 200(SRC) from a log Kow of 1.67(2) and a regression derived equation(3) indicates that 2,4-dinitrophenol is expected to have moderate mobility in soil(SRC). However, the pKa of 2,4-dinitrophenol is 4.09(4), which indicates that this compound will exist primarily as an anion in moist soil surfaces and anions are expected to have very high mobility in soils(SRC). Volatilization of 2,4-dinitrophenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) since the anion will not volatilize and the neutral species has a Henrys Law constant of 8.6X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 20 deg C(5). 2,4-Dinitrophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure of 3.9X10-4 mm Hg at 20 deg C(6). The biodegradation half-life of 2,4-dinitrophenol in an acidic soil was reported as 32.1 days and the biodegradation half-life in a basic soil was reported as 4.6 days(7).

Primary Organ: 
Dogs were administered bioallethrin in the diet at concentrations of 200, 1000, or 5000 mg/kg for 6 months (Griggs et al., 1982). No animals died during the study. General body trembling and irregular heart rhythm were noted at the highest dose level. Body-weight gain was slightly reduced in males receiving 1000 mg/kg diet and in both sexes receiving 5000 mg/kg. Consistent elevation in the mean levels of alkaline phosphatase was noted at 1000 and 5000 mg/kg in males, at 5000 mg/kg in females, and an elevated SGPT at 5000 mg/kg was observed in both males and females. No compound-related macroscopic changes were observed. Histological investigation revealed hepatocellular degeneration in both males and females in the groups receiving 1000 and 5000 mg/kg. This was associated with intracanalicular and hepatocellular pigmentation. Similar pigmentation was seen within the tubular epithelium of the renal cortex. The no-observed-adverse-effect level in this study was 200 mg/kg diet (equivalent to an intake of 6.1 and 7.2 mg/kg (1.6 ml) per day for males and females, respectively).

AQUATIC FATE: Two aqueous adsorption studies found that acetic acid exists primarily in the water column(1,2). The dominant environmental fate process for acetic acid in water is expected to be biodegradation(SRC). A large number of biological screening studies have determined that acetic acid biodegrades readily under aerobic(3-6) and anaerobic(7-9) conditions. In the AFNOR T 90/103 test, 36% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 5 days using microbes from 3 polluted surface waters(4). Greater than 90% degradation was reported in 3 days using an activated sludge inoculum in the Zahn-Wellens test(3). Acetic acid is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(10,SRC) based on a Henrys Law constant of 1X10-9 atm-cu m/mole at pH 7(11). According to a classification scheme(12), an estimated BCF of <1(10,SRC), from a log Kow value(13), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Zinc is an essential element and in vivo levels are therefore regulated by most organisms. Zinc is not biomagnified. The absorption of zinc by aquatic animals tends to be from water rather than food. Only dissolved zinc tends to be bioavailable, and bioavailability depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment and biological processes. Consequently, environmental assessment must be conducted on a site-specific basis.

Zinc is an essential element and in vivo levels are therefore regulated by most organisms. Zinc is not biomagnified. The absorption of zinc by aquatic animals tends to be from water rather than food. Only dissolved zinc tends to be bioavailable, and bioavailability depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment and biological processes. Consequently, environmental assessment must be conducted on a site-specific basis.

Primary Organ: 


After an inhalatory experiment in which rats were exposed for four hours to concentrations of 5000-12000 mg/cu m, ethylamine mainly acted on the eyes (swelling and milky look of the cornea, swollen eyes), nose (watery secretion), skin (etching effect on the eyelid), and the lungs (dyspnea). Morphological examination of the animals which died revealed an acuter hyperemia in the brain and blood filled spots with border emphysema in the lung. After a total dose of 10.82 g/kg sc applied to rats, ethylamine is a moderate inducer of duodenal ulcers and adrenocortical necrosis. After 14 days feeding experiments with 2.5% with mice and rats, megamitochondria are induced. ... Oxidative phosphorylation is not changed and the megamitochondria formation is reversible. In a short term toxicity study, rabbits that were exposed to a concentration of 90 mg/cu m 7 hours a day, 5 days a week during 6 weeks show peribronchitis and thickening of vascular walls in the lung. Some animals /develop/ muscular degeneration of the heart and multiple epithelial erosions; edema of the cornea and nictitating membrane are reported. No data /from/ long term experiments are available. Ethylamine is not mutagenic in bacteria. Ethylamine together with nitrite is mutagenic in a bacterial test. Ethylamine as an uncharged molecule is capable of penetrating the membrane which leads to a raise of pH and disturbances of many cell processes. ...

Oral NOAEL (no adverse effect level) was established at 3mg/kg/day.
RBC DECR
Reticulocyte count was decreased in male rats at dose level of 30mg/kg/day.
BLOOD BIOCH
The bilirubin level was increased in male rats of dose groups 10 and 30 mg/kg/day; it was decreased in female rats of 10 and 30mg/kg/day.
KIDNY TUBUL
Treatment related changes in the form of tubular nephrosis were observed in male rats of dose groups 10 and 30mg/kg body weight/day.
Test Results
KIDNY TUBUL
Multifocal, increased accummulation of tubular proteinaceous material was observed at the dose levels of 10 and 30mg/kg/ day. EDLC was calculated as = 0.02mg/kg/body weight using uncertainty factor.
General Comments : The accumulation of intratubular protein in male rats is considered as male rat charateristic and of low significance for human health. The UF was used as 500 because a fully significant period for this study was considered as 90 days. Recommendation was made for subchronic oral toxicity study (OECD 409).

EFFECTS OF SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE: 
Corrosive. The vapour is very corrosive to the eyes, the skin and the respiratory tract. Inhalation of vapour or mist may cause lung oedema (see Notes). The effects may be delayed. Medical observation is indicated.
NOTES  
DO NOT use perchloric acid in a hood designed for other purposes. The symptoms of lung oedema often do not become manifest until a few hours have passed and they are aggravated by physical effort. Rest and medical observation is therefore essential. Immediate administration of an appropriate spray, by a doctor or a person authorized by him/her, should be considered. Rinse contaminated clothes (fire hazard) with plenty of water. NEVER pour water into this substance; when dissolving or diluting always add it slowly to the water.

Abstract: 
Perchlorate competitively inhibits thyroidal iodide uptake and leads to perturbation of iodine economy. Iodine is indispensable element for synthesis of thyroid hormones essential for neurodevelopment in prenatal and neonatal periods. Potential health effects on long term exposure of perchlorate are not clear, especially in sensitive populations such as infants and children. The objectives of this project were to study tissue distribution of perchlorate and 125I in maternal, fetal and pup tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats and perchlorate-induced inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake in pregnant and lactating dams. Timed pregnant rats (n = 6) were treated with perchlorate (0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg-day) in drinking water from gestation day (GD) 2 until either GD20 or postnatal day (PND) 5. They were challenged with 125I and euthanized 2 hours later. In GD20 dams at 10 mg/kg-day dose group, perchlorate concentrations (ug/mL) in thyroid, serum, skin and gut contents (GC) were 70.3, 3.5, 4.5 and 4.7, respectively while those in PND5 dams were 61.2, 4.7, 7.0 and 5.5 respectively. Perchlorate levels in serum of fetal, male and female pups in 10 mg/kg-day dose group were 1.2, 2.1 and 2.1, respectively. Perchlorate levels in thyroid, skin and GC of GD20 & PND5 dams were higher than the serum levels, indicating active perchlorate sequestration in these tissues. 125I levels (ug/g) in thyroid of GD20 & PND5 dams were 10.6 and 8.1, respectively. 125I levels (ng/mL) in GD20 dams of serum, skin and GC were 38.9, 62.4 and 90.0, respectively while those in PND5 were 44.6, 32.6 and 110.0, respectively. Uptake of 125I into thyroid of both GD20 & PND5 dams were similar to control values in the perchlorate treated group, indicating the thyroid was up-regulated by TSH. 125I levels in the mammary tissue were inhibited by perchlorate in the lactating dams.

Primary Organ: 
Signs of acute fluoride intoxication in humans resemble those observed in animals. Dermal contact with HF either as liquid or as gas produces severe dermal lesions. Dermal contact with HF may result in systemic (cardiac) effects including death. Inhalatory exposure is highly damaging to the respiratory tract. Exposure to HF in a concentration of 1.16 mg/m3 will possibly result in some irritation. Prolonged oral intake of excess fluoride results in skeletal fluorosis, an effect for which indications were also found after inhalatory exposure. The available animal data set for HF permits the derivation of a NOAEL for repeated subchronic inhalatory exposure. No suitable studies are available to derive a NOAEL for HF for other routes of exposure. In a study with rats, changes in body and organ weights as well as haematological and clinical signs and death were seen at actual concentrations of 7.52 mg/m3; 6 hr/d; 5 d/w for 90 days. This value is equal to a duration corrected value (DCV) of 1340 ug/m3. Based on actual exposure levels a NOAEL of 0.72 mg/m3 is established. Because at higher dose levels apart from irritation also systemic effects occur, a duration corrected equivalent of this NOAEL is calculated. This duration corrected value (NOAEL) amounts to 128 ug/m3. (SIDS INITIAL ASSESSMENT PROFILE - Hydrogen fluoride)

Primary Organ: 
Signs of acute fluoride intoxication in humans resemble those observed in animals. Dermal contact with HF either as liquid or as gas produces severe dermal lesions. Dermal contact with HF may result in systemic (cardiac) effects including death. Inhalatory exposure is highly damaging to the respiratory tract. Exposure to HF in a concentration of 1.16 mg/m3 will possibly result in some irritation. Prolonged oral intake of excess fluoride results in skeletal fluorosis, an effect for which indications were also found after inhalatory exposure. The available animal data set for HF permits the derivation of a NOAEL for repeated subchronic inhalatory exposure.

Freshwater - In aquatic organisms fluoride accumulates primarily in the exoskeleton of crustacea and in the bones of fish.  No F accumulation was reported in edible tissues.  In fish, BCF values of 53-58 (d.w.) and <2 (w.w) were found (Slooff et al 1988).  In crustacea BCF-values based on whole body fluoride content are found to be <1 (based on dry weight).  The highest reported BCF values for mollusca and aquatic macrophyta were 3.2 and 7.5 (w.w.), respectively (Chaisemartin).   Seawater - In an experimental amrine ecosystem with fish, crustaceans and plants, F was found to accumulate in all species.  The highest value, 149, was found in fish.  BCF values for crustacea range from 27 to 62 (Hemens and Warwick 1972).  Fluoride concentrations up to 30 mg F/kg were found in consumption fish (Slooff et al 1988).

The highest reported BCF values for mollusca and aquatic macrophyta were 3.2 and 7.5 (w.w.), respectively (Chaisemartin).   Seawater - In an experimental amrine ecosystem with fish, crustaceans and plants, F was found to accumulate in all species.  The highest value, 149, was found in fish.  BCF values for crustacea range from 27 to 62 (Hemens and Warwick 1972).  Fluoride concentrations up to 30 mg F/kg were found in consumption fish (Slooff et al 1988).

Aquatic Fate : Freshwater - In fresh water at pH above 5, the free ion is the main fluoride species.  At lower pH, the proportion of flouride ion decreases, while HF2- and non-dissociated HF increase.  In the presence of phosphate insoluble fluorapatite is formed, a large part of which is transferred to the bottom sediments.  Seawater - In sea water fluoride belongs to the macrocomponents; the total fluoride content is divided in 51% F-, 47% MgF+, 2% CaF+, and traces of HF and HF2-  (Sloof et al 1988).

REMARK: Note that G.pigs are much more susceptible to acute toxicity of H2SO4 than other species, including primates.  G. pigs respond to sulphuric acid with a bronchospasm which is analogous to an asthmatic attack, so using G. pig data gives a conservative (health protective) value that would likely be protective of asthmatics.

REMARK: Due to the irritant and/or corrosive effects of H2SO4 the oral route of exposure is not appropriate for testing possible toxic endpoints. Gavage dosing of animals will notrepresent oral exposure in humans, which itself will be limited. Toxic signs of oral exposure in man are of irritation/corrosion of the gastrointestinal tract.

Direct exposure of the eyes to lower concentrations results in transient injury with complete recovery (Grant 1974). Eye irritation including lacrimation has been reported in humans exposed to sulfuric acid in air (Avol et al. 1988; Sim and Pattle 1957). The effect was worse at high humidity than at low humidity (Sim and Pattle 1957). Animal studies indicate that direct application of sulfuric acid into the eyes is corrosive (Murphy et al. 1982; Sekizawa et al. 1994). The concentration of sulfuric acid required to result in direct eye effects has not been clearly defined. A concentration of 10% was considered non-irritating in rabbits in one study (Sekizawa et al.1994) while a 10% concentration resulted in severe comeal opacities in rabbits with minimal effects observed at 5% in a second study (Murphy et al. 1992).

An early study of isopropanol manufacture in the USA using the strong-acid process demonstrated an excess of nasal sinus cancer. Studies of one US cohort of workers in pickling operations within the steel industry showed excesses of laryngeal and lung cancer after smoking and other potential confounding variables had been controlled for. A Swedish study of a cohort of workers in steel pickling also showed an excess risk for laryngeal cancer. A nested case-control study of workers in a US petrochemical plant showed an elevated risk for laryngeal cancer among workers exposed to sulfuric acid. Of two population-based case-control studies in Canada, one of laryngeal cancer showed an increased risk for exposure to sulfuric acid, and one of lung cancer suggested an excess risk; the latter also suggested a risk associated with exposure to mixed inorganic acids. In all these studies, sulfuric acid mists were the commonest exposure, and positive exposure-response relationships were seen in two of the studies.  Additional supporting evidence was provided by one cohort study in the soap manufacturing industry in Italy, which showed an increased risk for laryngeal cancer. Studies of three US cohorts and one Swedish cohort in the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing industry showed excess lung cancer, but there was potential confounding from exposure to radon decay products in some cohorts.  Animal carcinogenicity data: No data were available to the Working Group.  Evaluation: There is sufficient evidence that occupational exposure to strong-inorganic-acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.  Overall evaluation: Occupational exposure to strong-inorganic-acid mists is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).  [IARC. Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Man.

The 6.7A classification should only apply if:
1. A strong inorganic acid mist is generated i.e. the substance contains > 10% sulfuric acid and it is used in a manner where a mist is generated;
2. The mist is in an inhalable form i.e. MMAD of the droplets is < 100 um;
3. Humans are likely to be exposed to the mist.

Primary Organ: 
Concerning repeated exposures, oral administration (drinking water) in mice gave NOAELs of 26 mg/kg bw/day in males and 37 mg/kg bw/day in females based on a dose-related reduction of food and water consumption and local effect (duodenal mucosal hyperplasia). There is suggestive evidence from animal studies causing some concern that levels of about 10 mg/m3 may be associated with local changes in the lungs, reminiscent of oxygen toxicity, as well as local effects in the skin.

SIDS Initial Assessment Profile [SIDS]

Remark: In the environment H2O2 can be decomposed by various oxidation or reduction processes to oxygen or water at rates which depend on the presence of cataytic material (ions of transition metals, solid metals, activated carbon and enzymes, etc.) alkaline conditions, organic substances, heat and sunlight. The actual concentration of H2O2 in the environment results from a dynamic equilibrium between its production and generation. The rate of formation and degradation of H2O2 in sea water varies widely from 0.34 -
17 ug/l/h. Similar rates, 2 - 12 ug/l/h were found in freshwater. The half life of H2O2 in sea water samples from the Bay of Biscayne (filtered 0.2 um) was 60 h. The half life of H2O2 in freshwater (initial concentration 3.4 ug/l)
was 7.8 h (unfiltered) and 31 h (filtered, 1 um). Laboratory studies on water from the River Saone (France) showed that H2O2 degradation kinetics were of a first order and the half life is influenced by the initial H2O2 concentration. It could be shown, that the size of the microbial population in water has a significant effect to the degradation rate. The half life in waste water is
between minutes and hours and in sludge only a few seconds.
The half life of H2O2 in ground water at 11 -  32 m below ground level was found to be < 1h.

Bioccumulative: No
Hydrogen peroxide does not bioaccumulate (log Kow < - 1). Hydrogen peroxide adsorbs poorly to sediment particles and is rapidly degraded, thus accumulation in the sediment is also not expected.
SIDS Initial Assessment Profile [SIDS]

Rapidly Degradable: Yes
Type: abiotic
Remark: In the environment H2O2 can be decomposed by various oxidation or reduction processes to oxygen or water at rates which depend on the presence of cataytic material (ions of transition metals, solid metals, activated carbon and enzymes, etc.) alkaline conditions, organic substances, heat and sunlight. The actual concentration of H2O2 in the environment results from a dynamic equilibrium between its production and generation. The rate of formation and degradation of H2O2 in sea water varies widely from 0.34 -
17 ug/l/h. Similar rates, 2 - 12 ug/l/h were found in freshwater. The half life of H2O2 in sea water samples from the Bay of Biscayne (filtered 0.2 um) was 60 h. The half life of H2O2 in freshwater (initial concentration 3.4 ug/l)
was 7.8 h (unfiltered) and 31 h (filtered, 1 um). Laboratory studies on water from the River Saone (France) showed that H2O2 degradation kinetics were of a first order and the half life is influenced by the initial H2O2 concentration. It could be shown, that the size of the microbial population in water has a significant effect to the degradation rate. The half life in waste water is
between minutes and hours and in sludge only a few seconds.
The half life of H2O2 in ground water at 11 -  32 m below ground level was found to be < 1h.

Hydrazine induced reverse mutations in histidine auxotrophs of  S. typhimurium (Kimball, 1977; Anderson and Styles, 1978; McMahon et al.,  1979; Tosk et al., 1979; Parodi et al., 1981; Rogan et al., 1982), in  tryptophan auxotrophs of E. coli (McMahon et al., 1979; Von Wright and Tikkanen, 1980), and in a host-mediated assay with mice given a single dose of hydrazine sulfate by gavage (Simmon et al., 1979).  Intraperitoneal treatment of mice with hydrazine sulfate and radiolabeled formate or methionine produced radiolabeled 7-methylguanine in liver DNA and RNA, indicating that hydrazine mediated indirect alkylation of nucleic acids in vivo (Quintero-Ruiz et al., 1970).  Hydrazine induces DNA strand breaks in rat hepatocytes treated in vitro (Sina et al., 1983) and in the liver and lung of mice treated intraperitoneally with hydrazine hydrate (Parodi et al., 1981).  sister chromatid exchange was induced by in vitro treatment with hydrazine in Chinese 
hamster V-79 cells (Speit et al., 1980), Chinese hamster ovary cells (MacRae and Stitch, 1979), and Chinese hamster Don (lung) cells (Baker et al., 1983).  Hydrazine induced specific locus and recessive lethal mutations in D. melanogaster (Jain and Shukla, 1972; Shukla, 1972) but did not induce dominant lethal mutations in mice (Epstein and Shafner, 1968; Epstein et al., 1972).

_v0_7803-57-8,"Hydrazine hydrate, or >37 - 64% aqueous solution",6.7B,Suspected human carcinogens,GHS: Carcinogenicity - Category 2,"IARC Evaluation: There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of hydrazine. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of hydrazine. Overall evaluation: Hydrazine is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). 
     A. Evidence for carcinogenicity to humans (inadequate)
Two reports of cancer mortality in workers exposed to hydrazine have appeared in recent years. Choroidal melanoma was observed in one man who had been exposed to hydrazine for six years [ref: 1]. A preliminary report of an epidemiological study of men engaged in hydrazine manufacture revealed no unusual excess of cancer. This study comprised 423 men, with a 64% vital status ascertainment. None of the five cancers reported (three of the stomach, one prostatic and one neurogenic) occurred in the group with the highest exposure [ref: 2]. A follow-up study of this cohort [ref: 3] has extended it to 1982. Mortality from all causes was not elevated (49 observed, 61.47 expected), and the only excess entailed two lung cancer cases within the highest exposure category, with a relative risk of 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.2-4.5).
      B. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animals (sufficient)
Hydrazine has been tested in mice by oral administration, producing liver and mammary tumours and lung tumours in both P and F1 generations; after intraperitoneal administration to mice, it produced lung tumours, leukaemias and sarcomas [ref: 4,5]. After oral administration to rats, it produced lung and liver tumours [ref: 4]. When tested by inhalation, it produced benign and malignant nasal tumours in rats, benign nasal polyps, a few colon tumours and thyroid adenomas in hamsters, and a slight increase in the incidence of lung adenomas in mice [ref: 6].

Groups of 10 - 30 male Wistar rats were exposed to hydrazine (free base)  at average  concentrations of 6, 18, 26, 70, or 295
mg/m3 air, for 5 days/week, 6 h/day, over periods ranging from 5 to 40  days at  the 3 highest exposure levels to approximately 6 months at  the 2  lowest  exposure  levels.  The  control  group consisted of  10 rats.  Increased mortality  was observed at all exposure levels  but not  in controls,  and  body  weights  were decreased at the 3 highest exposure levels. Rats became sluggish during the  6-month exposure,  while at  the 3  highest exposure levels, an  initial restlessness  was followed  by a tendency to sleep. In  some cases,  pathological examination  revealed  lung oedema with  local damage  to the  bronchial  mucosa  at  the  3 highest exposure levels. Fatty livers were observed in many rats after 5 days of exposure at 295 mg/m3 (Comstock et al., 1954).

The pathological effects on the liver were also investigated microscopically, in  groups of 20 - 29 male DDY mice and 10 male
Wistar rats,  after administration  of 5, 10, or 20 mg hydrazine (free base)/kg  powdered diet, for 3 - 10 days. No animals died.
Animals of  both species exhibited weakness. Megamitochondria or fatty vacuolation with moderately swollen mitochondria and focal proliferation of  the smooth  endoplasmic reticulum were induced in rats  and mice  at dose  levels of  10 and 20 mg/kg feed. The induction of  megamitochondria was  a reversible  process (Waka- bayashi et al., 1983). Noda et al. (1983) observed centrilobular hepatic necrosis  in male  rabbits dosed for 5 days with between 14.6 and 32.3 mg hydrazine (hydrazine monohydro-chloride)/kg  body weight per day, iv.
    In other  studies, hydrazine  (hydrazine hydrate)  was given orally in  drinking-water to  albino rats  and guinea-pigs for 7 months at  levels providing  0.3, 0.03,  0.003, and 0.0003 mg/kg body weight  per day.  At the two highest doses, adverse effects were observed  in the  CNS (changes  in  conditioned  reflexes), liver (increased  I131 excretion,  changes in  enzyme  activity, protein  dystrophia),   and  blood   (symptoms  of   haemoloytic anaemia). The dose of 0.003 mg/kg body weight was reported to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level (Yaksctat, 1969).

REMARK: SKIN EFFECTS: Severely irritating [FMC Study I95-2035] Liquid and mist are corrosive (causing burns); direct contact could cause irreversible damage to eyes including blindness and/or irreversible destruction of skin tissue. Vapor/mist will irritate nose, throat and lungs but will usually subside when exposure ceases. 
REFERENCE SOURCE: FMC MSDS 5% peracetic acid solution [GOOGLE]

EXPERT JUDGEMENT: Acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid are all corrosive in their pure forms. This solution is 60-65% water which will dilute the corrosive properties but the data indicates the solution is still corrosive. This agrees with the UN sub risk.

[Dow Chemical USA Toxicology Research Laboratory; A 90-Day Repeated Inhalation Toxicity Study of Cumene Hydroperoxide in Rats (1979), EPA Document No. 868600016, Fiche No. OTS0510168]  Subchronic toxicity was evaluated in groups of 20 Fischer 344 rats (10 male and 10 female) exposed daily for 6 hours to 1, 6, 31, or 124 mg/m3 cumene hydroperoxide, 5 days a week for 3 months. Exposure at 124 mg/m3 was terminated after 5 days due to excessive toxicity; mortality was observed in 6/10 male, and 3/10 female rats at 12 days at which time the surviving animals were sacrificed.            
Clinical observations of animals in the 124 mg/m3 dose group at 12 days included eye and nose irritation, breathing difficulties, and decreased body weights. Pathological observations attributed to the effect of the test article in animals that died or were sacrificed in the 124 mg/m3 dose group included ulceration and inflammation of the cornea, nasal turbinates and lining of the stomach; while observations of thymic atrophy, depletion of lymphoid tissue in the germinal centers of some lymph nodes and the spleen, decreased lipid content of the liver, and decreased circulating white blood cells, were attributed to stress. Hematological observations in the 124 mg/m3 dose group included a generalized decrease in PCV, RBC and WBC count and a decrease in hemoglobin levels. Cumene hydroperoxide did not induce biologically significant changes in clinical, pathological, hematological, and biochemical parameters, or in urinalysis values, when administered at concentrations of 1, 6, or 31 mg/m3 in the animals maintained on exposure for the full 90 days.

Female Dutch Belted rabbits (groups of 16) were treated by gavage with a short chain length chlorinated paraffin (C10-13) with 58% chlorination (CP-SH) (IRDC, 1982d).  The rabbits were treated at dose levels of 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg body weight per day on gestation days 6-27 and examined on day 28.  There were no adverse effects on survival, body weight gain, clinical signs or postmortem observations in dams.  The highest-dose group had an increased incidence of whole  litter resorption (two dams), and in the group exposed to 30 mg/kg slight increases in the incidence of whole litter resorption (one dam) and early and late resorptions were observed.  Whole litter resorptions did not occur in the low-dose or control animals, but occurred in historical controls at an incidence of 13/277.  This indicated that the appearance of one or two dams with whole litter resorptions could occur by chance.  The NOAEL in this study was 100 mg/kg body weight per day.

A BCF value of 0.24 was measured for carp exposed to 0.5 mg/l of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol and a BCF of less than 2.2 was measured for carp exposed to 0.05 mg/l over a 6 week exposure period(1). According to a classification scheme(2), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.

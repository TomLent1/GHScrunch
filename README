GHScrunch by Akos Kokai
=========
A Python program for extracting Globally Harmonised System (GHS) hazard classification information for chemicals out of various international government documents. The program will output lists of chemicals with their associated hazard classifications in CSV format. The goal is to add these GHS classifications to datasets used for comparative chemical hazard assessment, particularly for assessments guided by the GreenScreen framework (http://cleanproduction.org/Greenscreen.php). It's a work in progress.

For information on the Globally Harmonised System, see:

INFORMATION SOURCES
===================
I use the official published classification documents from the following GHS implementations, all of which are included with this repo.


JAPAN GHS CLASSIFICATIONS
=========================
Classification results of 1424 chemicals by Inter-ministerial Committee (2006)
Classification Results of 52 chemicals by METI (2007)
Classification Results of 93 chemicals by METI and MOE (2008)

All three batches of classifications are distributed in series of Excel workbooks (xls), each containing up to 100 sheets. Each sheet contains the classification results for one chemical in an identical layout. Chemicals are identified by an index ID, CASRN, and chemical name. The 2006 classifications appear to be based on the first edition of GHS or on Revision 1. The subsequent classifications (which include new chemicals and updates to previously classified chemicals) are based on Revision 2. GHScrunch outputs the cumulative results of all the classifications and their updates. 

For reference, these are the hazard classes that are listed as separate rows in the Japan GHS spreadsheets:
Physical hazards
Explosives
Flammable gases
Flammable aerosols
Oxidizing gases
Gases under pressure
Flammable liquids
Flammable solids
Self-reactive substances and mixtures
Pyrophoric liquids
Pyrophoric solids
Self-heating substances and mixtures
Substances and mixtures, which in contact with water, emit flammable gases
Oxidizing liquids
Oxidizing solids
Organic peroxides
Corrosive to metals
Health hazards
Acute toxicity (oral)
Acute toxicity (dermal)
Acute toxicity (inhalation: gas)
Acute toxicity (inhalation: vapour)
Acute toxicity (inhalation: dust, mist)
Skin corrosion / irritation
Serious eye damage / eye irritation
Respiratory/skin sensitizer
Germ cell mutagenicity
Carcinogenicity
Toxic to reproduction
Specific target organs/systemic toxicity following single exposure
Specific target organs/systemic toxicity following repeated exposure
Aspiration hazard
Environmental hazards
Hazardous to the aquatic environment (acute)
Hazardous to the aquatic environment (chronic)

Note that Acute toxicity is subdivided into 5 exposure routes, and aquatic toxicity is subdivided into acute/chronic. We preserve those subdivisions in the output of this program. Additionally, the program teases apart "Respiratory/skin sensitizer" classifications into separate respiratory and skin sensitization subcategories (for consistency with GreenScreen).

For each hazard class, the spreadsheets tabulate the following results of chemical evaluations: 
- Classification
- Symbol (named)
- Signal word
- Hazard statement (unfortunately without codes)
- Rationale for the classification

The classification is probably the most important. It can be any of the following things:
- A category number and/or name, which depends on criteria set out specifically for each hazard class. 
- "Not Classified" - This phrase typically means that there was evidence of low hazard (i.e., safety).
- "Classification not possible" - This means that there were no data. Very different from "Not classified."
- "Not applicable" - Classification criteria are not applicable to this substance.

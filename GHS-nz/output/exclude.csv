Inhalation of hydrogen bromide causes irritation of the upper respiratory tract, and a concentration of about 35 ppm causes irritation of the throat after short exposure.  More severe exposures result in pulmonary edema, and often in laryngeal spasm. [Peer Reviewed] [Braker W, Mossman A; Matheson Gas Data Book 6th Ed p.372 (1980)][HSDB]

Sperm motility was decreased in mice exposed at 3 mg/m3 (the lowest concentration evaluated) and at higher concentrations, and increased numbers of abnormal sperm and decreased testis and epididymal weights occurred in mice exposed to 30 mg/m3. cobalt content in the urine of rats increased with increasing atmospheric cobalt exposure.

Primary Organ: 
Animals were exposed to the repeated inhalation of the cobalt metal blend used by the cemented carbide industry: a concentration of 20 mg/m3 of cobalt for 3 years produced hyperplasia of the bronchial epithelium and focal fibrotic lesions of the lungs with developing granulomata; daily inhalation of cobalt metal fume composed of approximately equal parts of cobalt, cobalt oxide, and cobaltic-cobaltous oxide did not elicit these reactions.  Guinea-pigs developed acute pneumonitis, often rapidly fatal, from the intratracheal injection of cobalt metal or repeated inhalation of a mixture of 75% tungsten carbide and 25% cobalt.  Chronic interstitial pnemonitis has been reported in workers in the cemented carbide industry, and cobalt has been conditionally implicated as the etiologic agent by a process of elimination of the other materials used in the industry.  Symptoms range from shortness of breath, cough, and dyspnea on exertion to permanent disability or death in some cases.  Among 12 workers exposed to cobalt engaged in manufacture of, or grinding with, tungsten carbide tools, who developed interstitial lung disease, there were 8 fatalities; serial chest roentgenograms over a period of 3 to 12 years revealed gradually progressive densities of a linear and nodular nature which gradually involved major portions of both lungs; cough, dyspnea on exertion, and reduced pulmonary function occurred early in the course of the disease.  The disease has features of hypersensitivity; only a small percentage of people exposed are affected and with little evidence of dose-response relationship.

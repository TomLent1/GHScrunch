1338-23-4,"2-Butanone, peroxide","Organic peroxides - Type B, Type D, or Type E",Exploding bomb and flame,Danger,Heating may cause a fire or explosion,"The United Nations number and the GHS classification are decided as follows by methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and diluent ratio;
Diluent type A >=48%, Available oxygen >10% and <=10.7%,  UNRTDG No.3101, Class:5.2, GHS Classification, Organic peroxides type B
Diluent type A >=55%, Available oxygen <=10%, UNRTDG No.3105, Class:5.2, GHS Classification, Organic peroxides type D

75-91-2,tert-Butyl hydroperoxide,Organic peroxides - Type A,,,,"Type classification is not possible due to lack of data, though organic compounds containing -O-O- structure, with active oxygen quantity calculated at 35.5%, that is, ""Organic peroxides."" Organic peroxides permitted for transport are assigned general entries by the UN Recommendation on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. As for tert-butyl hydroperoxide, only those diluted are given UN numbers (3103, 3105, 3107, 3109), subclassified into ""Type C,"" ""Type D,"" ""Type E"" and ""Type F"" according to their concentrations and proportions of diluents. Since those undiluted are interpreted as ""Type A"" (prohibited for transport), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (in neat liquid) is classified as ""Type A"" by GHS classification. Those diluted are assigned to Division 5.2 (UN#3103 Organic peroxides Type C (liquid), UN#3105 Organic peroxides Type D (liquid), UN#3107 Organic peroxides Type E (liquid) and UN#3109 Organic peroxides Type F (liquid )) by the UN Recommendation on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.

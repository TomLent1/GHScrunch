However, within the limits described in SIDS, EHC, Patty's and Hazard Data Collection, there was no data that showed respiratory effects by inhalation exposure to Hydroquinone. Therefore, at the present stage, data is not sufficient for carrying out GHS classification about the repeated exposure on respiratory systems. As for blood system, there is animal test data where ""hematological changes, such as anisocytosis, polychromasia and acidophilic erythroblasts"" were observed within the guidance value ranges of ""Category 1"" (collection of hazard data, EHC). On the other hand, there is a case of human volunteers with no effect on blood (EHC), and this case is adopted in the section of evaluation on the human health risk in EHC. Therefore, although effects on blood system are observed in the study using rats, it can be judged that there is no effect on human blood system and it is considered equivalent to ""Not classified"" on blood system according to GHS classification. As for central nervous system, referring to EHC, the data which has become the rationale for three-minitsry GHS classification was turned out to be the case where ""tremor and decreased activity were observed immediately after administration"". Since this is regarded as the effect due to single exposure, it is considered proper to exclude central nervous system from the target organs for repeated exposure. As for liver, hepatotoxicity is observed in the study using mice within the guidance value ranges of ""Category 2"" and not observed in the study using animals such as rats. Moreover, there is no human case exhibiting hepatotoxicity. However, at present, it is considered proper to be defined as ""Category 2 (liver)"" based on the data on mice. As for kidney, although nephropathy is found in F344 male rats by repeated exposure of this substance, nephropathy is not found in F344 female rats, SD rats, Carworth rats, dogs and mice (Patty's). Moreover, it is indicated in SIDS, EHC, and Patty's that F344 female rats are sensitive to effects on kidney. Therefore, since nephropathy is considered to be a symptom peculiar to F344 male rats, it is considered proper to exclude kidney from the target organs for repeated exposure.

Moreover, although they pointed out in the public comments that from the weight of evidence it is appropriate to adopt CICAD, according to GHS United Nations documents, even when data is not cited in documents highly regarded by experts, it is possible to use it for GHS classifications. As for the respiratory system, in ACGIH the TLV-TWA is set while taking respiratory effects into consideration, and in CICAD Respiratory tract irritation is given as a toxicological endpoint. Moreover, according to the data of Roshchin (1952) in ACGIH, nasal discharges including bleeding and focal lung edema are observed within the guidance value ranges of ""Category 1"" in the inhalation exposure test using rats. Therefore, it is considered proper to be classified as ""Category 1 (respiratory system)"". Referring to Sjoberg (1955), the primary literature of human data, which is also a rationale for three-ministry GHS classification, about effects on blood system and nervous system, it is concluded that ""no general toxicity which should be noted is observed"" though decreasing tendency in hemoglobin and significant fatigue symptoms are found in several patients. Therefore, it is not appropriate to regard blood system and nervous system as specific target organs for repeated exposure based on this literature.

Although 2-trimethyl acetyl- 1,3-indandione (it is hereafter considered as a pival) are rodenticide, by inhibition of coagulation, there is little toxic data of this substance. The indandiones compounds including pival have prothrombin formation inhibitory effect, and the part of the compounds are also used as the coagulation inhibitors clinically. As the side effects, diarrhea, pyrexia, renal tubular necrosis, and dermatitis are known, and also when repeated doses are carried out, there is cumulative to inhibition of coagulation. Based on the above thing, in order to minimize damage by inhibition of coagulation, the recommended value of acceptable concentrations of pival is set as 0.1 mg/m3. Since the recommended value of acceptable concentrations of pival is set, there are histories which considered it as ""the Hazardous Materials.

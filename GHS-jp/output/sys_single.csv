Kidney effects are evidenced by interstitial nephropathy and decreased urinary output along with proximal renal tubular damage showing Fanconi's syndrome represented by proteinuria, hematuria, urinary cast, glycosuria and aminoaciduria.

The effects on hematopoietic function such as hemoglobin synthesis inhibition due to delta-aminolevulinic acid/heme synthetic enzyme inhibition and anemia caused by shortened survival of red blood cells are considered representative of toxic actions of inorganic lead. Kidney effects are evidenced by interstitial nephropathy and decreased urinary output along with proximal renal tubular damage showing Fanconi's syndrome represented by proteinuria, hematuria, urinary cast, glycosuria and aminoaciduria. Inorganic lead adversely affects the central and peripheral nervous systems, displaying in particular weakening of the muscle of the limbs, pain and spasm.

Inhalation or oral ingestion of inorganic lead has been reported to induce oral contraction and thirst, along with nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, abdominal pain and constipation suggesting gastrointestinal toxicity. The effects on hematopoietic function such as hemoglobin synthesis inhibition due to delta-aminolevulinic acid/heme synthetic enzyme inhibition and anemia caused by shortened survival of red blood cells are considered representative of toxic actions of inorganic lead. Kidney effects are evidenced by interstitial nephropathy and decreased urinary output along with proximal renal tubular damage showing Fanconi's syndrome represented by proteinuria, hematuria, urinary cast, glycosuria and aminoaciduria. Inorganic lead adversely affects the central and peripheral nervous systems, displaying in particular weakening of the muscle of the limbs, pain and spasm. 
There have been rare reports of adults exhibiting ataxia, headache, paresthesia, depression and coma indicative of toxic effects on the central nervous system when exposing to extremely high doses (details not shown).

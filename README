A Python program for extracting Globally Harmonised System (GHS) hazard classification information for chemicals out of various international government documents. The program will output lists of chemicals with their associated hazard classifications in CSV format. The goal is to add these GHS classifications to datasets used for comparative chemical hazard assessment, particularly for assessments guided by the GreenScreen framework (http://cleanproduction.org/Greenscreen.php). It's a work in progress.

For information on the Globally Harmonised System, see:

INFORMATION SOURCES
===================
I use the official published classification documents from the following GHS implementations, all of which are included with this repo.


JAPAN GHS CLASSIFICATIONS
=========================
Classification results of 1424 chemicals by Inter-ministerial Committee (2006)
Classification Results of 52 chemicals by METI (2007)
Classification Results of 93 chemicals by METI and MOE (2008)

All three batches of classifications are distributed in series of Excel workbooks (xls), each containing up to 100 sheets. Each sheet contains the classification results for one chemical in an identical layout. Chemicals are identified by an index ID, CASRN, and chemical name. The 2006 classifications appear to be based on the first edition of GHS or on Revision 1. The subsequent classifications (which include new chemicals and updates to previously classified chemicals) are based on Revision 2. This program outputs the cumulative results of all the classifications and their updates. 

For reference, these are the hazard classes that are listed as separate rows in the Japan GHS spreadsheets:
  PHYSICAL HAZARDS:
	Explosives
	Flammable gases
	Flammable aerosols
	Oxidizing gases
	Gases under pressure
	Flammable liquids
	Flammable solids
	Self-reactive substances and mixtures
	Pyrophoric liquids
	Pyrophoric solids
	Self-heating substances and mixtures
	Substances and mixtures, which in contact with water, emit flammable gases
	Oxidizing liquids
	Oxidizing solids
	Organic peroxides
	Corrosive to metals
  HEALTH HAZARDS:
	Acute toxicity (oral)
	Acute toxicity (dermal)
	Acute toxicity (inhalation: gas)
	Acute toxicity (inhalation: vapour)
	Acute toxicity (inhalation: dust, mist)
	Skin corrosion / irritation
	Serious eye damage / eye irritation
	Respiratory/skin sensitizer
	Germ cell mutagenicity
	Carcinogenicity
	Toxic to reproduction
	Specific target organs/systemic toxicity following single exposure
	Specific target organs/systemic toxicity following repeated exposure
	Aspiration hazard
  ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS:
	Hazardous to the aquatic environment (acute)
	Hazardous to the aquatic environment (chronic)

Note that Acute toxicity is subdivided into 5 exposure routes, and aquatic toxicity is subdivided into acute/chronic. We preserve those subdivisions in the output of this program. Additionally, the program teases apart "Respiratory/skin sensitizer" classifications into separate respiratory and skin sensitization subcategories (for consistency with GreenScreen).

For each hazard class, the spreadsheets tabulate the following results of chemical evaluations: 
- Classification
- Symbol (named)
- Signal word
- Hazard statement (unfortunately without codes)
- Rationale for the classification

The classification is probably the most important. It can be any of the following things:
- A category number and/or name, which depends on criteria set out specifically for each hazard class. 
- "Not Classified" - This phrase typically means that there was evidence of low hazard (i.e., safety).
- "Classification not possible" - This means that there were no data. Very different from "Not classified."
- "Not applicable" - Classification criteria are not applicable to this substance.


KOREA GHS CLASSIFICATIONS
=========================
The amended list of GHS classification and labelling for toxic chemicals (2011)

This document is in 한국어, with only substance names in English. Fortunately, it is straightforwardly structured and includes numeric GHS chapter references for hazard classes, and H-statement codes. I was able to confirm my understanding of the document using Google Translate. The program creates GHS-kr.csv, containing a list of substance names; CASRN; a field combining hazard class, category, and H-statements (in English); and M-factors. It further outputs a file called hazards.txt, containing a list of all the combined hazard class/category/H-statement fields that appear in the dataset.

For reference, these are the hazard classes that are represented in this list:
  PHYSICAL HAZARDS:
	Flammable gases
	Gases under pressure
	Flammable liquids
	Flammable solids
	Substances and mixtures which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases
	Oxidizing solids
	Organic peroxides
  HEALTH HAZARDS:
    Acute toxicity (oral)
	Acute toxicity (dermal)
	Acute toxicity (inhalation)
	Skin corrosion/irritation
	Serious eye damage/irritation
	Respiratory sensitization
	Skin sensitization
	Germ cell mutagenicity
	Carcinogenicity
	Reproductive toxicity
	Specific target organ toxicity - Single exposure
	Specific target organ toxicity - Repeated exposure
	Aspiration hazard
  ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS:
	Hazardous to the aquatic environment (acute)
	Hazardous to the aquatic environment (chronic)

In the spreadsheet, each line describes one substance with one hazard classification. Columns E-F are the hazard class and category, respectively (e.g. the first one is Oxidizing solids (2.14), Category 3). Columns G-J are for labeling, respectively: symbol (coded), signal word, and hazard statement (coded), and M-factor. There are multi-row merged cells that span classifications for the same CASRN. Sometimes you get a CASRN for each row when using xlrd to read the cells, sometimes not.

Using the hazard class names allows us (via Google Translate) to distinguish the following hazards that have the same GHS chapter number:
	급성 독성-경구 (3.1) = Acute toxicity - oral
	급성 독성-경피 (3.1) = Acute toxicity - dermal
	급성 독성-흡입 (3.1) = Acute toxicity - inhalation
	피부 과민성 (3.4) = Skin sensitization
	호흡기 과민성 (3.4) = Respiratory sensitization
	수생환경유해성-급성 (4.1) = Hazardous to the aquatic environment - acute
	수생환경유해성-만성 (4.1) = Hazardous to the aquatic environment - chronic

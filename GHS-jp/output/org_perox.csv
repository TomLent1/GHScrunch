Organic peroxides permitted for transport are assigned general entries by the UN Recommendation on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. As for tert-butyl hydroperoxide, only those diluted are given UN numbers (3103, 3105, 3107, 3109), subclassified into ""Type C,"" ""Type D,"" ""Type E"" and ""Type F"" according to their concentrations and proportions of diluents. Since those undiluted are interpreted as ""Type A"" (prohibited for transport), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (in neat liquid) is classified as ""Type A"" by GHS classification. Those diluted are assigned to Division 5.2 (UN#3103 Organic peroxides Type C (liquid), UN#3105 Organic peroxides Type D (liquid), UN#3107 Organic peroxides Type E (liquid) and UN#3109 Organic peroxides Type F (liquid )) by the UN Recommendation on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.
